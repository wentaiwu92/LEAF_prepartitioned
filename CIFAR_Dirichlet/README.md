## Pre-partitioned CIFAR-10/100 by Dirichlet distribution
Pre-partitioned CIFAR-10/100 via the torchvision library using a customizable Dirichlet distribution. The resulting subsets can be regarded as non-iid client datasets that follow different multinomial distribution in the label space.

See the python notebook (*Dirichlet_CIFAR_demo.ipynb*) for more details.
